# Pi 5 + Freenove-style 4WD board: hardware prototype

**Status:** standalone prototype scripts, written and run on the real car on 2026-11-08. They live outside the `locatebot` package, are **not wired into `locatebot.pi`**, and have **no unit tests**. Use them as a hardware reference and a source for a real `MotorDriver`, not as production code.

**Operating the car as an LLM** (bring-up checks, the botd tools, find-and-drive, answering requests from the phone app, safety rules, deploying alongside other agents): [`LLM_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`](LLM_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md).

Answers to the open hardware questions in `docs/PROJECT.md` §2 for this car: the drive is **4 DC motors through H-bridges fed by a PCA9685 PWM chip** (skid steering, no steering servo), and there are **no wheel encoders**.

## Hardware map (verified on the car)

Front = camera side. "Left/right" are the car's own left/right (looking forward from behind it).

| Part | Interface | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 13 trixie) | – | I2C, SPI enabled; serial left **off** (GPIO 14/15 are line sensors) |
| PCA9685 PWM chip | I2C bus 1 @ `0x40` (all-call `0x70`) | 50 Hz (shared with the servos) |
| Front-left motor | PCA9685 ch 0 / 1 | forward = ch **1** |
| Back-left motor | ch 2 / 3 | forward = ch **2** |
| Back-right motor | ch 4 / 5 | forward = ch **5** |
| Front-right motor | ch 6 / 7 | forward = ch **6** |
| Camera pan servo | ch 8 ("Servo 0") | **14.3 µs per degree** (measured: 220 µs = 15.4°), > 1500 µs looks **left**, usable ±35°, ~1.2° backlash |
| Camera tilt servo | ch 9 ("Servo 1") | 1500 µs ≈ level |
| ADS7830 8-ch ADC | I2C `0x48` | ch 2 = battery (raw ~160–180, **not calibrated to volts**); ch 0/1 probably light sensors |
| SSD1306 128×64 OLED | I2C `0x3C` | |
| Buzzer | GPIO 17 | active high |
| Ultrasonic | trigger GPIO 27, echo GPIO 22 | gpiozero `DistanceSensor` |
| IR line sensors L/M/R | GPIO 14 / 15 / 23 | 1 = surface detected |
| Camera | CSI CAM/DISP 0 | OV5647; this mount needs **no** rotation. libcamera picks a 1080p **crop** mode: f = **1290 px at 960 px wide, HFOV 40.8°** (measured with a LiDAR-measured turn). `AeExposureMode=Short` keeps photos sharp while driving. A Camera Module 3 + third-party cable was never detected |
| LiDAR | USB, CP2102N → `/dev/ttyUSB0` | **RPLIDAR C1**, 460800 baud, model byte `0x41`, health Good. Car front = LiDAR **2.4°** (182.4° while it was mounted reversed for part of 2026-11-08). **Check after any remount:** a 1 s straight drive (`/goto?bearing=0&seconds=1`) must shrink the LiDAR's front slices and grow its rear (measured 10:15: front −72 cm, rear +117 cm), and `/bins` front must agree with the camera and the ultrasonic |
| Battery | 3 × 18650 in series (11.1–12.6 V) | Board "Power" switch feeds the Pi, "Load" feeds motors/servos. With board power off the I2C chips disappear |

Motor H-bridge truth table as used here: forward channel = PWM, other = 0 → drive; both = 4095 → **short brake** (stops in ~6 cm instead of coasting); both 0 → coast.

`pi/calibration.json` holds the measured forward channel per wheel, `swap_lr: false` (verified with before/after photos: `drive(l=40, r=-40)` turns **right**), the LiDAR front angle and per-wheel gains (`wheel_gain`, all 1.0: with fresh batteries and a correct LiDAR front the car drives straight). The copy here is the final state from the car (the Pi was off when this was committed; the values are the ones set live).

## Conventions: different from the package
These scripts predate reading the repo rules and **do not follow the package invariants**:
- LiDAR angles are the RPLIDAR's native **degrees, clockwise** (+90° = right), not radians CCW with +y left.
- `drive(left, right)` takes per-side speeds −100..100; turn sign: `turn > 0` = right.
- No `NaN`/coverage handling: a 10° slice with no returns is treated as 150 cm free (`motion.py`), which the package rules forbid ("NaN is unknown, never free").

## Find and drive to an object (LocateAnything + an LLM choosing)
Verified on the car on 2026-11-08: drove to an orange crate from ~5 m (one smooth run, stopped ~37 cm in front, confirmed by the ultrasonic), to the "EPICS 129" cardboard box several times, and found a yellow drill standing on the floor 4–5 m away.

```text
scan   car still; camera pans 35°L..35°R (5 photos) → LocateAnything on the Orin for "<what>"
       → colour check if a colour is named → same object in two photos merged → numbered choices + tagged sheet
choose an LLM (or a person) picks a number from the tagged photos
orient car still: ONE graded pulse at a time (0.04 / 0.06 / 0.08 s by error) + photo, until within ±4°
drive  far (box < 120 px): straight and continuous, NO steering; photo checked on the move (zoomed window for
       small targets); re-aim (stopped) only if > 4° off
       near: 0.4 s hops, a sharp stopped photo after each, re-aim if > 4° off
arrive ultrasonic/LiDAR confirms it is right in front (< ~40–60 cm) or it fills the frame;
       stopped by an obstacle while it was big and centred = arrived (the obstacle is the target)
```

```bash
# Orin (once per boot): model load ~65 s
~/locatebot/.venv/bin/python orin/locate_server.py            # needs ~/locatebot with the model + engine built
# Pi
pi/restart_botd.sh
# laptop
ORIN_URL=http://<orin>:8091 CAR_URL=http://<pi>:8000 python3 laptop/choose.py scan "orange box"
ORIN_URL=... CAR_URL=... python3 laptop/choose.py go 1
```

What made it work (each was a real failure first):
- **Keep the model loaded** on the Orin: 448 px frames take **1.1 s** per item (512 px 1.5 s, 640 px 2.1 s, 960 px ~5 s); the CLI reloads the 4.7 GB model every call (~60 s).
- **Colour check** for colour words: LocateAnything boxes brown cardboard for "orange box". Measured on this camera: orange crate hue 6 / sat 219, cardboard hue 33 / sat 115–145 (PIL hue 0–255). For "cardboard box" only vivid orange is rejected.
- **Turn while stopped, drive straight without steering.** Steering from a live LiDAR heading estimate while moving made the car circle (bad scan-to-scan matches in clutter). Measured straight driving: ±1–2° per 1.5 s at 30 %.
- **One pulse at a time.** Two or three pulses in a row overshoot (the first pulse from rest turns ~4°, following ones ~10°+).
- **Stop short, then creep.** A detection takes ~1.2 s; driving through it near the target overshoots. Re-aim at > 4°, or a small offset grows into driving past the target.
- **Clean start:** jump straight to the cruise power from standstill; a slow ramp lets one side start first and twists the car.
- **Never drive blind** (2026-11-08, after two overshoots): a photo on the move that misses the target stops the car at once (it used to "keep aiming" and drive on until the ultrasonic hit the drill at 3 cm); the drive watchdog is 2.5 s. A low target right in front is below the camera: after an obstacle stop the car tilts the camera down (tilt > 1500 = down) and looks before calling it "something else".
- **One big turn, then move:** lining up is one continuous pivot sized from botd's calibrated turn rate (`/state.turn_rates`, deg = rate·s + offset; left ≈ 193°/s, right ≈ 72°/s), with at most one smaller follow-up; offsets up to 12° are steered on the move (`/aim?rel=…&visual=1`). Strings of small pulses looked like constant fidgeting.
- **Lost after driving → turn around:** one quick ~180° pivot (~1 s, not the 30 s measured turn), scan; then the two sides. The target is usually behind or beside the car after an overshoot. It turns and drives forward to it; reversing would be blind (the camera only looks forward). LocateAnything can return false matches (a dark machine part with a yellow panel for "drill"): check the photo.

## Phone app for demos (2026-11-08)
`botd.py` serves `pi/web/` at `http://raspberrypi.local:8000/`. Anyone on the same Wi-Fi can watch the camera, drive, or type a request; the LLM handles requests from the laptop:
```bash
python3 laptop/qa.py watch                        # in the background: exits (= notification) when a request arrives
python3 laptop/qa.py claim 1
QA_ID=1 python3 laptop/choose.py scan "yellow drill"   # QA_ID: milestones appear live under the request in the app
QA_ID=1 python3 laptop/choose.py go 1
python3 laptop/qa.py answer 1 "Found it ..." finds/choices/final_choice1.jpg
```
- **Joystick**: the stick position is mixed into wheel powers (`l = y + 0.6x`, `r = y - 0.6x`, scaled so the stronger wheel gets 0.30 → the speed-bar maximum as the stick is pushed further; a small centre dead zone; pure sideways spins in place at ≥ 0.36). Sent every 150 ms while held; letting go sends `/stop`. W A S D / arrows move the stick too.
- **Hold-to-drive** (`/manual?l=&r=`): each call drives ~0.35 s, so the car stops by itself when the finger lifts or the connection drops; power capped at ±0.55; forward is refused when something is within `20 + 50 × power` cm, or when there is **no** distance reading at all; a person driving cancels any mission. Leaving the page or switching tabs sends `/stop`.
- **Live video** (`/stream`, MJPEG): one shared camera grabber for all viewers, ~6 fps at 960 px (~760 KB/s per viewer). Requests through a tunnel (`X-Forwarded-For` set) or `?size=small` get 480×270 at ~3 fps (~38 KB/s).
- **Progress and photos**: `POST /progress {id, text}`, `POST /upload?name=` (JPEG body) so answers can show laptop-side photos.
- **What the Orin sees, on the live video** (`POST /detections`, `GET /vision`): `choose.py` sends every LocateAnything result to the car and the app draws it as a labelled box over the stream. After a scan, a fresh still photo at the final camera position is detected on the whole frame (look-around photos are blurred mid-pan, and horizon-strip boxes are cut off at the strip edge), and the numbered choices are labelled (`yellow drill #1`). A box is drawn only while it still matches the view: same camera pan, and the wheels have not moved since its photo (detections made while driving show for ~1.4 s as they arrive). An object moved by hand is not noticed until the next detection.
- **From anywhere** (optional): install the ngrok agent on the car (`~/bin/ngrok`, add your authtoken), copy `pi/tunnel_policy.example.yml` to `~/car/tunnel_policy.yml` with a real password, run `pi/tunnel.sh`; it prints the https link. The app can drive a real robot: always keep the password on.
- Measured: "Find the yellow drill" typed into the app, about 6 m away. Turned −11° → −1.6° in 3 pulses, drove straight, lost the small target on the move (watchdog stop), rescanned (found at +25°, close), 6 pulses + 3 checked hops, **stopped 30 cm in front** (ultrasonic). ~70 s, all steps shown live in the app.

## Cute wander (2026-11-08)
`/wander?head=1&seconds=120` (the app's **Wander** button): roams like `wander`, plus a camera "head".
- **Head:** the pan servo sweeps ±28° with a small wobble (15 Hz updates, slew-limited, writes only on ≥ 3 µs change). Before an avoid turn it looks 34° toward the side it is about to turn to, then the body follows; a nod (tilt) when clear. Every 15–25 s in open space (front > 1 m) it stops, looks left, right, nods and carries on.
- **Not hitting things:** speed 34 % by default (40 % max in this mode); the usual avoid (brake, "blocked" photo, back up if the rear is clear, pivot to the more open side); the corner escape above; no stop-and-pan photos. Any joystick use or Stop cancels it.
- Measured, 45 s at 30 %: cruised the whole time with the head sweeping ±34°, one look-around, two avoids for a person's feet (shoe at 33 cm, dark trousers at ~50 cm: both seen and turned away from), 0 I2C errors, head re-centred at the end. Keep people a step back: 33 cm is close.
- Head-only check without moving: `/wander?head=1&speed=0&seconds=8` (the wheels only steer while rolling; avoid still runs if something comes within 38 cm).

## Calibration numbers (2026-11-08)
- Braked pivot pulse at 0.36 power: 0.04 s ≈ 4°, 0.06 s ≈ 7°, 0.08 s ≈ 10° (first pulse from rest smaller). The LiDAR measures a still-to-still pivot to ~0.1° (ICP noise floor 0.01°) when the turn is small.
- Straight at 30 %: ~35 cm/s; 0.4 s hop ≈ 9 cm, ±0.8°.
- Moving-power floor 0.30 (0.25 let the weaker side stall and pivot the car); short-brake 0.1–0.15 s for crisp stops.

## Run
```bash
scp -r pi/ <pi>:car/                                  # code lives in ~/car on the Pi
ssh <pi> 'cd ~/car && python3 car.py calibration'     # no motion
ssh <pi> 'cd ~/car && python3 motion.py approach 40 3 --dry'   # full loop, motors off
laptop/carrun.sh 'python3 motion.py approach 50 6'    # drive at a box, stop at 20 cm
CARRUN_WAIT=320 laptop/carrun.sh 'python3 motion.py wander 40 180 --photos'
```
Keep the wheels off the ground for first runs and a hand near the car; there is no hardware kill switch.

## Measured on the real car (2026-11-08)
- **Approach + brake:** from 88 cm at a 50 % target, speed eased down from ~100 cm and the car stopped **20.8 cm** from a box (target 20 cm). Without predictive stop + short-brake it stopped at 5–7 cm (coasting on a shiny floor).
- **Wander, 3 min:** ~146 s driving, 40 avoid manoeuvres, 57 event photos, no hard collision reported by the sensors.
- **Turning by time is unreliable** on a slippery floor: 0.14 s pivot @ 40 % ≈ 16°, 0.2 s @ 50 % ≈ 40°. Turns need measuring (scan matching or a gyro).
- **Lower duty still moves fast:** 12 V into the motors means even ~30 % duty is quick; `motion.py` uses a 700/4095 floor.
- **LiDAR blind spots:** dark trousers returned nothing (legs 30 cm away were invisible); a ~30 cm cardboard box in front was below the scan plane. The ultrasonic caught both. → camera/ultrasonic are needed for low and dark objects.
- **SSH over the team Wi-Fi drops often**; run motion detached (`carrun.sh`).

## Known problems
- **No hardware failsafe.** The PCA9685 keeps its last PWM if the process is `kill -9`'d or hangs. Needed before unattended runs: a watchdog that pulls the PCA9685 OE pin or cuts motor power.
- LiDAR returns inside the car's own outline (`BODY_*` in `motion.py`) are now ignored: after the remount, 8–14 cm hits at front-left made the front clearance −4 cm, so forward was always "blocked". If the front reads oddly short, check for a loose wire near the LiDAR.
- **Corner trap (fixed in `wander`):** it once spent ~33 s pivoting between a wall and a cart. Now three avoids within 12 s trigger an escape: back up (if the rear is clear) and turn up to ~150° until the front is open.
- Came within ~1–3 cm of a person's dark-trousered legs: people need a camera detector and a larger margin.
- Some event photos are blurred (taken while still turning).
- `laptop/lr_check.py`'s phase correlation gave the **wrong** left/right answer once (low correlation peak); compare photos visually instead.
- Battery ADC is uncalibrated.
- **Going around obstacles is weak.** `choose.py` sidesteps (back up, ~30° toward the LiDAR-open side, short drive, look with the camera) but a small, far target behind an obstacle is often lost. Needs path planning on the LiDAR map.
- **A remounted LiDAR silently breaks everything:** with the front angle wrong by 180°, the car braked for things behind it, crawled, and the weaker side stalled into a left pivot. Re-check `/bins` after touching the LiDAR.
- **Fixed: an unpowered or unplugged ultrasonic froze `botd`.** gpiozero's `DistanceSensor` (default `partial=False`) waits forever for a full queue of echoes, which blocked the asyncio loop, so the control loop, missions and `/stop` all hung (seen with the battery switch off). Now `partial=True` (no echo = no update, the reading goes stale), and `/stop` cuts the motors directly before cancelling the mission.
- `restart_botd.sh` used to report "botd up" while the new process had refused to start (the old one was still shutting down); it now waits for the old process to exit.
- **Fixed: I2C `Remote I/O error` (121) on the motor chip** (1–2 a minute, 39 in ~30 min). smbus2 selects the chip address and then transfers in two ioctls; the control loop and the HTTP threads (battery ADC, camera pan) interleaved them. `hw.py` now serialises every chip access with one re-entrant lock (`pi/test_hw_threading.py`): 0 errors in over an hour on the car. `motion.py` also latches a fault after a failed motor write (`reason: control_fault`, `pi/test_control_fault.py`): the car stays stopped until botd restarts rather than resuming stale motion. Both by a parallel agent (Hermes), merged here.
- `botd.py` is not started at boot (run `pi/restart_botd.sh`), and the motor chip used to return I2C `Remote I/O error` (121) (see above); the control loop now logs it (`/state.control_err`) and keeps running instead of dying silently.
- `seek.py`/`find.py` live-LiDAR heading tracking (`/goto` without `visual=1`) is unreliable while moving; use `choose.py`.

## `locatebot.pi.MotorDriver` for this board
`locatebot/pi/pca9685_motor.py` (`PCA9685SkidSteer`, tests in `tests/pi/test_pca9685_motor.py`) implements the package's `MotorDriver` for this board: `set(throttle, steering)` (package frame, +steering = left) becomes `left = throttle - steering`, `right = throttle + steering`, scaled to keep the ratio, mapped through the forward-channel table above with a 700/4095 duty floor; `stop()` turns channels 0–7 off in one I2C write and never touches the camera servos; `brake()` short-brakes. It is tested against a fake I2C bus only: it has **not** driven the car yet and is not wired into `tools/pi_drive.py`. It still needs the hardware failsafe above.
